 I read books, I put titles here, what questions they answer.



#### Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software 2nd Edition

book is about computers(digital ones), very well written. I'm fascinated by power of abstraction and book is all about abstraction and layers of abstractions in computer.
this book gave me a good big picture of how computer works(but in every details, of course I don’t know).

- what really is code?
- what are zeros and ones, why and how?
- how electricity (electrons) can represent 0 and 1?
- Morse code, flashlights, zero and one, what they have in common?
- what is circuit and switch?
- what is Boolean Algebra and why?
- what is logic gate?
- but how to do arithmetic?
- how can we build such a functional computer with logic gates?
- what are transistor and semiconductors?
- what is CPU and RAM and how they work?
- what is instruction set?
- what is op code, what is data?
- how can you represent "almost" everything with zeros and ones?
- what is abstraction? (such a powerful concept)
- what is machine code?
- what is assembly code?
- what is higher lever programming language?
- what is operating system? (giant software we take for granted)
- many more...
