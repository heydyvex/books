 I read books and put my comment on them here.



#### Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and SoftwareÂ 2nd Edition

book is about computers(digital ones), very well written. I'm fascinated by power of abstraction and book is all about abstraction and layers of abstractions in computer.
this book gave me a good big picture of how computer works(but in every details, of course I donâ€™t know).

###### Questions it answers:
- what really is code?
- what are zeros and ones, why and how?
- how electricity (electrons) can represent 0 and 1?
- Morse code, flashlights, zero and one, what they have in common?
- what is circuit and switch?
- what is Boolean Algebra and why?
- what is logic gate?
- but how to do arithmetic?
- how can we build such a functional computer with logic gates?
- what are transistor and semiconductors?
- what is CPU and RAM and how they work?
- what is instruction set?
- what is op code, what is data?
- how can you represent "almost" everything with zeros and ones?
- what is abstraction? (such a powerful concept)
- what is machine code?
- what is assembly code?
- what is higher lever programming language?
- what is operating system? (giant software we take for granted)
- many more...



#### Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future

Ok, first of all, this book is kind of books that I have to read every year, there are just too much wisdom, Author is Peter Thiel.
Thiel is very critical about things that he discusses in book and it is nice to see he thinks out loud.
Book is about how to build the future how to succeed building it. I must reread it every day.

- about future, how to get from 0 to 1, build new things and improve dramatically
- technology vs globalization
- startups: rethinking from scratch
- competition is for losers and it is not good strategy
- build a monopoly
- definite optimism, indefinite optimism, definite pessimism, indefinite pessimism
- reject tyranny of chance, you are not a lottery ticket
- find secrets and make it a product
- start a startup with storng foundation(Thiel's law)
- how to choose best poeple and work with
- how to sell a product
- people(globalization) are substitutions, (technology)computers are complementary(stillðŸ˜…)
- why did cleantech fail
- why tesla succeed
- the funder's paradox



#### Feynman lectures on Computation

I wasnâ€™t aware of this book that even exist, I thought Mr Feynman only gave lecture on physics so it was a hell of a surprise for me.
As title says, it is about computation, from logic gates to explain Turing machine to Quantum computers.
I'm going to use this book as reference for Computation.



#### Effective C: An Introduction to Professional C Programming

Nice introduction to C, I like the style, not very detailed to be boring just enough information about important subjects.
Last chapters seems usefull, like program structure and testing C code. 



#### Beej's Guide to C Programming
I really like this book, every chapter every well written, it is open source, and not boring.
I someone would look for a book to learn C, I would recommend this book.
